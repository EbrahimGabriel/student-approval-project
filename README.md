# CMSC 100 B1L Group 2 Project

## Reminders:
1. Before doing anything, pull from the repository.
2. Create a separate branch (git checkout -b branchname) and work from there.
3. Name your branches closely to the feature you are working on (e.g. student-signup, student-approval, etc.)
4. When commiting, follow the lab conventions (or kung pumayag si ma'am na kahit ano then: branchname: 'commit message') 
5. When pushing, do not push to the main branch! Push to the branch you are working on. (git push origin branchname) 
6. Afterwards, create a pull request to be reviewed and merged with main.

## How to make a pull request
1. Go to the github link and click pull requests.
2. Click new pull request.
3. Set the base branch to main and the compare branch as the branch you are working on (naka dropdown box sila)
4. Add title and description of the things you did.
5. After that, create the pull request.
